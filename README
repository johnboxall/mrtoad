Mr.Toad is a remote console for webpages.

Open the console and then paste the debug script into the page you'd like to test.
Navigate to your testing page with your phone and shabang, instant remote debugging.

A hosted version is available:

Things are still pretty raw. Thanks nodejs / socketio / jsconsole / storejs for all the pieces!
