# JS Console

A JavaScript web console, useful for quick experimentation, debugging, presentations (for live coding) and workshops.

Also available as a [native iOS app](http://jsconsole.com/app/) from the iTunes store

# Features

- Resizable font (yep, biggest issue with Firebug in workshops)
- Autocomplete in WebKit desktop browsers
- shift + up/down for bigger console
- Save history (based on session)
- Add support for loading in a DOM (YQL - I thank you again)
- Permalink to individual executions

# TODO

- Permalink to session (trickier, server side required - can I do it without?)
